# Nand2Tetris

My project files for the Nand2Tetris Coursera Course - Building a computer from scratch. 
In this course I wrote the logic for the Nand gate all the way up to an assembler I wrote in python to 
convert machine language into binary.

This course was very challenging but so enlightening. Before this course, computers really did seem like magic. I will forever appreciate the 
programming languages of today and that I don't have to write in binary or machine code!
